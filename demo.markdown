# Introduction

The Capacity and Performance engineering profession lacks a 'Performance Engineering Body of Knowledge (PEBoK)', even though lots of books are written about the topics.

# The Learning Objective
The overall learning objective is to be able to understand IT system performance in terms of its capacity and cost structure and apply that understanding in the engineering of IT systems that meet desired needs such as performance and cost. 

This is a preliminary objective, for further inspiration look at the ABET outcomes a-k http://www.abet.org/about-abet/ (ABET is an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology)


# Learning objectives drill down
+ Basic concepts: being able to express simple capacity and performance metrics and ways to measure them, and understand how capacity and system design is related to performance. 

+ Skills: which are the skills (and some knowledge) that are needed to perform the roles.

+ Engineering: what are the roles in getting the performance and the capacity matched up.
